## Creating your course

In the upper right of this screen, click `Use this template` and follow the steps to set up your course's GitHub repository.

Name your repository fill in a short description (If this is an ITCR course, start the repo name with `ITCR_`).

_Trigger the workflow to set up the Github issues that you can use to guide your set up of this course_:   
- Go to `Actions` > under `Workflows` click on `Issue Filer`.
- Where it says `This workflow has a workflow_dispatch event trigger.` click `Run workflow` and then click the green button that says `Run workflow`.
- Now if you go to `Issues` you will see issues filed that you can follow to set up the new course!

Now start filling out the documents with the information for the course!

_If you are creating an ITCR course:_

- Delete `_output.yml` and `index.Rmd` files
- Keep the `_output-itcr.yml` and `index-itcr.Rmd` files but delete the `-itcr` parts of those file names.

_If you are creating any other courses:_

- Delete the `_output-itcr.yml` and `index-itcr.Rmd` files.

Now, you can go through each file (the issues have checklists to guide you) and make sure the existing Rmd template files are changed to fit your course, and delete the `code_output` folder if you do not expect to have any code output (or if you wish to call the folder something else).
There are `{}` in these files to get you started filling out information and should be deleted after you've filled them out.

### Recommended repository settings:

With your course repository set up, there are some settings recommended for development.

#### Set up GitHub pages

Go to `Settings` > `Pages`.

- Under `Source`, pick the drop down menu and pick `main` and `/docs`.  
- Then click `Save`.  
- Lastly, check the box that says `Enforce HTTPS` at the bottom of this page.   

##### Set up branches

Go to `Settings` > `Branches` and click `Add rule`.
For `Branch name pattern`, put `main`.

_Protect the main branch_:  
Then check the box that says `Require pull request reviews before merging`.

_Make sure branches are updated_:  
- Check the box that says `Require status checks to pass before merging`.
- Underneath this also check the box that says `Require branches to be up to date before merging`.

_Use automatic spell and URL checks_:  
After the first pull request, a couple of checks will automatically happen and then appear here in settings.
Then, you can require these checks to pass before merging pull requests by returning here and selecting them - they are `url_check` and `style-n-check` they will check that the urls work and that the code is styled using the `stylr` package and that the spelling is correct using the spelling package respectively.
See the [Github Actions section](#github-actions) for more details on these.

After setting up these new branch items, click `Create` and `Save changes`.

### Set up Github secrets

The Github actions that this repository uses needs four Github secrets set up.

It's important that these are set up and named exactly what they are below in order for Github actions to work correctly.

See [Github Actions section](#github-actions) for how you can customize Github actions which can change the necessity of these secrets.  

![Github secrets](resources/git-secrets.png)

To set up these repository secrets, on your repository's main Github page, go to `Settings` and scroll down to see `Secrets` on the left side menu bar.

For each new secret, click the `New repository secret` button and set each as follows, clicking `Add secret` as you fill each in appropriately:  

_Name: `GIT_TOKEN`_:  
For `value`: Create a personal access token [following these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-token). Underneath `Select scopes`, check both `repo` and `workflow`.
Then copy the PAT and save as the value.

#### Dockerhub related Secrets

Note these are not required if [Docker update Github actions are turned off](#about-customizing-render-bookdownyml-also-called-build-all).

_Name: `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`_:  
For `value`: put your login username for https://hub.docker.com/

_Name: `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`_:   
For `value`: put a access token for Dockerhub.
You can create this by following [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/#create-an-access-token).

#### Google Slide related Secrets

Note these steps are not required if [Google slide update Github actions are turned off](#about-customizing-render-bookdownyml-also-called-build-all).

Before following these steps, you'll need to set up the Google slides following the [instructions here](#adding-images-and-graphics).

To set up Google Slides Github Actions, you'll need to do some set up, but you will only have to do this once.

You'll need three secrets and you'll need to run some steps in your local R/RStudio _outside of Docker_ to get some of them.

Install the package, `rgoogleslides` if you have not before.
```
install.packages("rgoogleslides")
```
Then, run the following:
It will open up a browser and ask you to sign in
```
token <- rgoogleslides::authorize()
```

There are two tokens you'll need, an `ACCESS` token and a `REFRESH` token.
Once you've run the above steps you can get these tokens by running for the `ACCESS` token:
```
token$credentials$access_token
```
and for the `REFRESH` token:
```
token$credentials$refresh_token
```

Now to set up these as Github secrets, on your repository's main Github page, go to `Settings` and scroll down to see `Secrets` on the left side menu bar.
Click the `New repository secret` button and set each as follows, clicking `Add secret` as you fill each in appropriately:  

_Name: `GOOGLE_SLIDE_ACCESS_TOKEN`_:  
For `value`: paste the output from `token$credentials$access_token` from the steps above.

_Name: `GOOGLE_SLIDE_REFRESH_TOKEN`_:  
For `value`: paste the output from `token$credentials$access_token` from the steps above.

Lastly, set your Google Slide ID:

_Name: `GOOGLE_SLIDE_ID`_:  
For `value`: set the presentation ID of your main Google Slides for this course.
Set up the Google slides following the [instructions here](#adding-images-and-graphics).
The [<presentationID> is in the URL](https://developers.google.com/slides/how-tos/overview#the_structure_of_a_presentation) of your Google Slide:
```
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/<presentationId>/edit
```

Once you click `Save` for all of these, you should be all set.

## Setting up the Docker image

Particularly for courses that involve running example code, it's recommended that you use a Docker image for development to maintain software version consistency across course developers.

If you are new to Docker, you may find it helpful to read [Carrie Wright's explanation about what Docker is for](https://carriewright11.github.io/covid_epi/#new-to-docker).
- You will need to [sign up with a Docker account](https://hub.docker.com/) if you don't have one.  
- If you haven't installed Docker desktop (or need to update it), you can do [so here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).  

If your Docker desktop is running, you should see a Docker whale in your tool bar.
On Macs, this will be on the bar on the top of your screen; in Windows, on the bottom right.

A Docker image is similar to a virtual machine - it contains preinstalled software in a preconfigured environment.
Docker images can be downloaded from DockerHub, or you can create your own.

We have created the `course_template` image as a starting point; you can download it from `jhudsl/course_template` on DockerHub using the docker pull command we have below.
To pull the docker image associated with this template, you can run this command below in your command line.
This may take a while.

```
docker pull jhudsl/course_template
```

This pulls the course_template image from Docker Hub and copies it to your computer.
It will be placed in your local collection of Docker images, managed by Docker (not in your pwd).

To use the Docker image associated with the course template, first navigate to the the top of this GitHub repository.
Now you can start up the Docker container using the command below.

This runs your local copy of the course_template image (which you downloaded from DockerHub).
The option `-v $PWD:/home/rstudio` mounts pwd (this repo) and makes it available at `/home/rstudio` within the container.
Replace all of `<CHOOSE_PASSWORD>` (including the `<` and `>`) with a password of your choosing.

_On a Mac_:  
```
docker run -it -v $PWD:/home/rstudio -e PASSWORD=<CHOOSE_PASSWORD> -p 8787:8787 jhudsl/course_template
```

_On a Windows_:  
```
docker run -it -v %CD%:/home/rstudio -e PASSWORD=<CHOOSE_PASSWORD> -p 8787:8787 jhudsl/course_template
```

Do not close this window, but you can minimize it.
Open up a new command line window and run the command: `docker ps`, you should see a container is up and running!

In a web browser navigate to the following to get to an RStudio that is ran from your Docker container.

```
localhost:8787
```

To log in, you'll need to use `rstudio` as the username and whatever password you put for `<CHOOSE_PASSWORD>` in the above command.

_Couple other handy Docker commands:_

- To stop your Docker container, run `docker ps` to obtain the docker container ID.
Then you can use that ID to run `docker stop <CONTAINER_ID>`.  
- To remove a docker image (which you may need to do from time to time to clear out space), you can run `docker image ls` to see all your current images.
Then you can run either `docker image rm <IMAGE_ID>`.  
- If you really need to clear out space, you can follow this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44785585/docker-how-to-delete-all-local-docker-images) on how to remove all images and all containers.  

For more info on how to use Docker, they have very [extensive documentation here](https://docs.docker.com/).

### Starting a new Docker image

Should you find that your course needs additional packages beyond what's included in the template, you should probably start a new Docker image.

To start up a new Docker image for your new course, you can start with the Dockerfile in this repository and add the additional packages you need using the tips in the next section, but you'll need to change the tag.

### Adding packages to the Dockerfile

If you find you need a new package to run the code you are adding, you'll need to add the package to the `docker/Dockerfile`.

Try to keep things in alphabetical order where possible.

#### Template commands for adding packages to the Dockerfile

For R packages installed from CRAN, you can add to the running vector list of R packages.

To add an R package from Bioconductor, you can follow this kind of format:

```
RUN Rscript -e "options(warn = 2); BiocManager::install( \
  c('limma', \
    'newpackagename')

```

To add an R package from GitHub you can add a line that follows this general format (need a comma and space):

```
RUN Rscript --vanilla install_github.R \
  --packages "jhudsl/didactr, jhudsl/ottrpal, <NEW_PACKAGE>" \
```

To add a Python package, you will need to add pip3 to install Python packages using this format:
```  
RUN pip3 install \
    "somepackage==0.1.0"
```

#### Rebuilding the Docker image

When you've added a package to the Dockerfile, you'll need to check that it builds successfully before including it in a pull request.
You'll need to rebuild the docker image using this command:
```
docker build -< docker/Dockerfile -t jhudsl/<TAG_FOR_COURSE>
```
If it fails, often the issue is a missing dependency.
Take a look at the error messages and see if you can determine the issue with some Googling.

Once it builds successfully, you should file a PR with your Dockerfile changes.
Once the changes are accepted and merged, we'll need to push the updated image to Dockerhub using:

```
docker push jhudsl/<TAG_FOR_COURSE>
```

When you file a pull request, the Dockerfile build will be tested automatically by the [GitHub actions](#github-actions).

## Citations

You can generally follow the [Bookdown instructions about citations](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/bibliography.html), but you don't need to add the additional bibliography argument at the top of the Rmds.

To add a new reference source, add to the `book.bib` file, keeping your new entry in alphabetical order.

For articles (or anything with a DOI), go to [doi2bib.org](https://www.doi2bib.org/) to get a BibTex-formatted reference.

Then copy and paste the reference to the `book.bib` file.

You can also use programs like Zotero or Endnote to export a .bib file and either combine with the `book.bib` or manage your references from there.

Other sources can be added using this template:
```
@website{citekey,
    author = {First Last},
    title = {Title},
    url  = {http://www.someurl.html},
}
```

To reference the citations in your writing follow the [bookdown instructions](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/bibliography.html):

> Items can be cited directly within the documentation using the syntax @key where key is the citation key in the first line of the entry, e.g., @R-base. To put citations in parentheses, use [@key]. To cite multiple entries, separate the keys by semicolons, e.g., [@key-1; @key-2; @key-3]. To suppress the mention of the author, add a minus sign before @, e.g., [-@R-base].

## Github actions

Here's a summary of the Github actions set up in this repository.

![](resources/GHASetUp.png)


### About customizing render-bookdown.yml (also called `build-all`)

Note that `build-all` and `docker-build-test` are not something we recommend requiring for status checks because `docker-build-test` is only run if there are changes to the Dockerfile and `build-all` is only run upon the acceptance and merging of a pull request.

However for simplicity purposes there are two sections this Github action that you can delete if you won't be making changes to the docker image or wanting it to sync to Google Slides.

#### For a course that will NEVER need changes to Docker image

If you know for sure that the course you are working on will never require Docker updates -- this may be the case if the course doesn't any interactive code as a part of the material, you can delete the Docker updating chunk.
In the file `.github/render-bookdown.yml` you can delete the part marked by
`###### START OF DOCKER UPDATE CHUNK` up to the part that says `###### END OF DOCKER UPDATE CHUNK`.

This will make the build-all steps run faster and will make it so you don't have to set up the Docker related Github secrets.

#### For a course that does not need linking to Google Slides

If you know for sure that the course you are working on does not need Google Slide automatic updating, you can delete the Google Slide updating chunk.
In the file `.github/render-bookdown.yml` you can delete the part marked by
`###### START OF GOOGLE SLIDE UPDATE CHUNK` up to the part that says `###### END OF GOOGLE SLIDE UPDATE CHUNK`.

This will make the `build-all` steps run faster and will make it so you don't have to set up the Google Slide related Github secrets but ALL edits to the Google Slide will need to be done by hand.

### Linking to Leanpub repository

`transfer-rendered-files.yml` is a Github action that will copy over the output `docs/` files rendered by Bookdown to a parallel `Leanpub` repository.

Once `build-all` is run, the `docs/` folder where the rendered files are place are copied over to the Leanpub repository and filed as a pull request.

There are two edits to `.github/workflow/transfer-rendered-files.yml` that need to be done to turn on the automatic copying of files between these repos:  

1) Change line 28 to the repository name you would like the `docs/` files to be transferred to.
```
repository: jhudsl/Course_Template_Leanpub
```

2) Uncomment lines 13-18 in this file:
```
# Only run after the render finishes running
#workflow_run:
#  workflows: [ "Build, Render, and Push" ]
#  branches: [ main ]
#  types:
#    - completed
```

### Style guide

Github actions will run the [`styler` package to all style R in all Rmds](https://github.com/jhudsl/DaSL_Course_Template_Bookdown/blob/main/.github/workflows/style-and-sp-check.yml) whenever a pull request to the `main` branch is filed.
Style changes will automatically be committed back to your branch.

### Spell check

Github actions will automatically [run a spell check on all Rmds](https://github.com/jhudsl/DaSL_Course_Template_Bookdown/blob/main/.github/workflows/style-and-sp-check.yml) whenever a pull request to the `main` branch is filed.

It will fail if there are more than 2 spelling errors and you'll need to resolve those before being able to merge your pull request.

To resolve those spelling errors, go to this repository's `Actions` tab.
Then, click on the GitHub action from the PR you just submitted.
Scroll all the way down to `Artifacts` and click `spell-check-results`.
This will download a zip file with a TSV that lists all the spelling errors.

Some of these errors may be things that the spell check doesn't recognize for example: `ITCR` or `DaSL`.
If it's a 'word' the spell check should recognize, you'll need to add this to the dictionary.

Go to the `resources/dictionary.txt` file.
Open the file and add the new 'word' to its appropriate place (the words are in alphabetical order).
Then commit the changes to `resources/dictionary.txt` to your branch and this should make the spell check status check pass.

### Google Slide Github Actions

There are two actions ran in `render-bookdown.yml` that attempt to keep Google Slides updated:
Note that the steps in [Google Slide related Secrets](#google-slide-related-secrets) need to be followed in order for these to properly run.

1) `google_slides_image_linker.R` makes sure any code output images are updated after bookdown is re-rendered.
2) `google_slide_png_downloader.R` downloads all the slides from the linked Google slide set as PNGs to `resources/gs_slides`.

If you don't wish for either of these actions to occur automatically, you can delete these steps from [`render-bookdown.yml`](https://github.com/jhudsl/DaSL_Course_Template_Bookdown/blob/main/.github/workflows/render-bookdown.yml).

### Running spell check and styler manually

If you are using the [Docker container](#setting-up-docker-image), or otherwise have the `spelling` and `styler` package installed, you can run spell check and styling locally on all Rmds by running this:

```
Rscript scripts/spell-check.R
```

The spell check results file will be saved to a file called `spell_check_results.tsv`.
This file should not be pushed to the GitHub repository (it is in the gitignore so this shouldn't happen).

### URL Checking

[GitHub actions](#github-actions) runs a check on all the URLs upon creating a pull request to the `main` branch.
If it fails, you'll need to go the `Actions` tab of this repository, then find the GitHub `check_urls` job for the last commit you just pushed.
Click on `check_urls` and the specific step of `Check URLs` to see a print out of the URLs tested.

If the URL checker is failing on something that isn't really a URL or doesn't need to be checked, open up the GitHub actions file: `.github/workflows/url-checker.yml` and add the imposter URL on to the `exclude-urls:` argument with a comma in between.

### Adding logo

Logos for the table of contents are added with the  `_output.yml` file. This adds this an image above the table of contents when the content is rendered with `bookdown`.

**Please replace the URL in the line 13 of code for the `_output.yml` file with the URL for the GitHub repo for your course.** This will allow people to more easily find how out how you created your course. Otherwise, they will be directed to this template.

If you are creating an ITCR course for [ITN](https://www.itcrtraining.org/) then delete the `_output.yml` file and rename the `_output-itcr.yml` to be `_output.yml`.  Please modify the lines that link to the http://jhudatascience.org/ with your own website and logo if you are not part of the [jhuDaSL](http://jhudatascience.org/) . Again also replace the URL in line 13 for your repository.

If you wish to create a project specific DaSL bookdown with a different color scheme, the font colors can also be modified in the `assets/style.css` file.

## Setting Up Images and Graphics

Also replace the logo link which is currently: `"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhudsl/DaSL_Course_Template_Bookdown/main/resources/images/logo.png"` if you are working on a project with the DaSL that has its own project logo.
Create an image file with both the project logo on the left and a [black and white version of the DaSL logo](https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/gDNxkEZuMRVEkvXukGY96pLe) on the right and host this online on GitHub so that others working on your project can use the link so that the logo will get updated if need be.

To maintain style and attributions for graphics and images, as well as to enable easy updates in the future, please start a new Google Slide document for your course.
This also allows you to make videos of your slides that can be added to your course.

Each Rmd with images that is a part of your bookdown needs to have this chunk at the beginning so that images are stored properly for Leanpub conversion:
`````
```{r, include=FALSE}
fp <- knitr::fig_path()
fp <- dirname(fp)
fp <- paste0("images/", fp, "/")
print(paste0("figpath is ", fp))
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = fp)
```
`````

Next, import the appropriate theme (see [this video](https://youtu.be/pNbwF263yY8) for assistance):

#### Themes for non-ITCR projects:

 - If you are not creating a course as part of a larger collaboration but simply just as a DaSL course, import the theme from this [template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YmwKdIy9BeQ3EShgZhvtb3MgR8P6iDX4DfFD65W_gdQ/edit?usp=sharing). Once you have done this add a slide with the "Title slide" layout under layouts - and add your course title.

 ![](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YmwKdIy9BeQ3EShgZhvtb3MgR8P6iDX4DfFD65W_gdQ/export/png?id=1YmwKdIy9BeQ3EShgZhvtb3MgR8P6iDX4DfFD65W_gdQ&pageid=p)


 - If you are working on a project (more likely) with the [Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab](http://jhudatascience.org/) than import the theme from this [template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qa3v_zlNedCKHQ6IYF5MM1ZLZLgHUs0U4usgDRRe3W8/edit?usp=sharing).

Add a title slide and update it with your project's logo.


![](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qa3v_zlNedCKHQ6IYF5MM1ZLZLgHUs0U4usgDRRe3W8/export/png?id=1qa3v_zlNedCKHQ6IYF5MM1ZLZLgHUs0U4usgDRRe3W8&pageid=p)


In either case:

Be sure to add a terms of use slide to let people know about our licensing.

![](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YmwKdIy9BeQ3EShgZhvtb3MgR8P6iDX4DfFD65W_gdQ/export/png?id=1YmwKdIy9BeQ3EShgZhvtb3MgR8P6iDX4DfFD65W_gdQ&pageid=gcc4fbee202_0_153)

Please select the layout that looks like this for any images/content from outside sources:

![source_layout](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qa3v_zlNedCKHQ6IYF5MM1ZLZLgHUs0U4usgDRRe3W8/export/png?id=1qa3v_zlNedCKHQ6IYF5MM1ZLZLgHUs0U4usgDRRe3W8&pageid=gcf1264c749_0_140)

Please update the text at the bottom to describe the source.

Once complete, your slides can be downloaded and a static version can be added to your bookdown and or Leanpub repository to build your course. See [this link](https://www.howtogeek.com/509046/how-to-save-google-slides-objects-as-images/) for information on how to download slides from Google Slides.

Images should be stored in `resources/images/` or you can link directly to your GoogleSlides following [the instructions here](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s425/client/snv?noteGuid=fd22f17a-5b1e-c3d6-eb85-e47c20aa4b1d&noteKey=58951432cb4f6f996ad9a28df6852248&sn=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evernote.com%2Fshard%2Fs425%2Fsh%2Ffd22f17a-5b1e-c3d6-eb85-e47c20aa4b1d%2F58951432cb4f6f996ad9a28df6852248&title=Google%2Bslides).  

Also add notes to each slide describing the text or images of the slide to allow for the content to be accessible to vision impaired individuals, as this can be converted to audio when creating videos.

#### Themes for ITCR project:

 - If you are not part of the [Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab](http://jhudatascience.org/), import the theme from this [template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lMNTlY8S21cNG4hL6NoOmXYZBQ30BtCQ4UdUJ7J_Wvs/edit?usp=sharing). Once you have done this add a slide with the ITN2 layout - and add your course title and any logos for your organization(s) that may be appropriate like so:

Also be sure to add a terms of use slide to let people know what licensing that you have chosen.
You can use ours (that looks like the slide below) if you like or create your own with a different license.

Please update the text at the bottom to describe the source.

Once complete, your slides can be downloaded and a static version can be added to your bookdown and or Leanpub repository to build your course. See [this link](https://www.howtogeek.com/509046/how-to-save-google-slides-objects-as-images/) for information on how to download slides from Google Slides.

Images should be stored in `resources/images/` or you can link directly to your GoogleSlides following [the instructions here](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s425/client/snv?noteGuid=fd22f17a-5b1e-c3d6-eb85-e47c20aa4b1d&noteKey=58951432cb4f6f996ad9a28df6852248&sn=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evernote.com%2Fshard%2Fs425%2Fsh%2Ffd22f17a-5b1e-c3d6-eb85-e47c20aa4b1d%2F58951432cb4f6f996ad9a28df6852248&title=Google%2Bslides).  

Also add notes to each slide describing the text or images of the slide to allow for the content to be accessible to vision impaired individuals, as this can be converted to audio when creating videos.

### Accessibility

Each slide and image added to the courses needs to be accessible.
There are two things to check for each slide:

- [ ] Each slide is described in the notes of the slide so learners relying on a screen reader can access the content. See https://lastcallmedia.com/blog/accessible-comics for more guidance on this.

- [ ] The color palette choices of the slide are contrasted in a way that is friendly to those with color vision deficiencies.
You can check this using [Color Oracle](https://colororacle.org/).

## Adding images and graphics in text

All images should be included in your Google Slides with the captions we discussed above.
To add images in the text in your Rmd, use the following function within an [R code chunk](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/r-code.html).

`````
```{r, fig.alt="Alternative text",}
ottrpal::include_slide(<google_slide_url>)
`````
_You must define `fig.alt` in the code chunk options/parameters to pass to `knitr`._
You can adjust the size, alignment, or caption of the image you can use these arguments in the code chunk tag:  

`````
```{r, fig.alt="Alternative text", fig.height=4, fig.align='center', fig.cap='...'}

`````

It's also okay to use `<img src` for your images if you like you but you still need to make sure that you have alternative text designated using something like: `<img src="blah.png" alt="SOMETHING">`.

## Learning Objectives Formatting

Each chapter should start with Learning objectives!
You can use [this handout](https://www.bu.edu/cme/forms/RSS_forms/tips_for_writing_objectives.pdf) to help you craft learning objectives.

Learning objectives should be stated both in the slides and in the beginning of each bookdown chapter.
Because of this, you may find it most handy to use the [`List layout`](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-7UvgVq5tP1pasTEErUM3bJFH2fU_pilH6i6_81CCXU/export/png?id=1-7UvgVq5tP1pasTEErUM3bJFH2fU_pilH6i6_81CCXU&pageid=gcf0c1d8548_0_141) slide for stating your Learning objectives and then embed that in the book from your GoogleSlides [the instructions here](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s425/client/snv?noteGuid=fd22f17a-5b1e-c3d6-eb85-e47c20aa4b1d&noteKey=58951432cb4f6f996ad9a28df6852248&sn=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evernote.com%2Fshard%2Fs425%2Fsh%2Ffd22f17a-5b1e-c3d6-eb85-e47c20aa4b1d%2F58951432cb4f6f996ad9a28df6852248&title=Google%2Bslides).

## Bookdown Rendering

As you modify the names of the chapters of your course and add more chapters (using the `.Rmd` files), you need to update the `_bookdown.yml` file accordingly.

For example let's say that we added another chapter and named the file `03-chapter_of_course.Rmd`.
We would update our `_bookdown.yml` to look like this:

```yaml
book_filename: "Course_Name"  
chapter_name: "Chapter "  
repo: https://github.com/jhudsl/DaSL_Course_Template_Bookdown/ ##Make sure you update this for your GitHub Repo!!  
rmd_files: ["index.Rmd",  
            "01-intro.Rmd",   
            "02-chapter_of_course.Rmd",   
            "03-chapter_of_course.Rmd",  ##Only this is new!
            "about.Rmd"]  
new_session: yes  
delete_merged_file: true  
language:  
  ui:  
    chapter_name: "Chapter "  
output_dir: "docs"  
```

Notice how only one line is different - the one that says `03-chapter_of_course.Rmd",`
Be careful about quotation marks: `""` as well as commas: `,`!

Once we do this we can preview the book!

You can do so by typing:
`bookdown::serve_book()` in the RStudio Console.  

Note that when you run `bookdown` it will create an `.rds` file; you can generally ignore this file.

You will then see a live version of your book in your RStudio viewer.

Note that When a pull request is merged to main, `bookdown::render_book()` will be re-run by the [GitHub actions](#github-actions) and the results added to `main`.
