# Introduction

Welcome to the AnVIL Getting Started guide!  In it you will find step-by-step instructions for setting up your accounts, as well as guides on how to use some of AnVILâ€™s key features.

### What Is AnVIL?

AnVIL is NHGRI's Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space.  It provides a platform for performing genomic data analysis on the cloud.

#### Does AnVIL Cost Money?

Through AnVIL, you pay for computing resources as you use them.  If you'd like to try it out, new users can claim a $300 Google Cloud credit to test out the platform and perform some small analyses.

We also provide a [cost estimator](budget-templates.html#types-of-costs).
