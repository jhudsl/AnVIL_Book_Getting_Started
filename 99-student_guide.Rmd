# Student Guide

## Activity One

You might want to create a student guide that contains a different subset of Rmd files from your book, or renders to a different output format (e.g. word document). You can specify the output and Rmd files that will be used for the student guide using the `_output.yml` and `_bookdown.yml` files in the student-guide directory.
