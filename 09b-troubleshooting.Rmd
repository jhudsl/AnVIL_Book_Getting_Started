# Troubleshooting

### Create Terra Billing Project

The error messages generated during billing project creation can be hard to understand (see [this example](https://help.anvilproject.org/t/error-creating-billing-project/47).  If you get an error message,

- Double check that your project name follows the rules.
- **If your chosen name follows the rules but you are getting an error then the name may be already taken** - try adding something (e.g. your lab or team name, date, etc.) to make it unique.
