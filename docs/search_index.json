In it you will find step-by-step instructions for setting up your accounts, as well as guides on how to use some of AnVIL’s key features. 1.0.1 What Is AnVIL? AnVIL is NHGRI’s Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space. It provides a platform for performing genomic data analysis on the cloud. 1.0.2 Does AnVIL Cost Money? Through AnVIL, you pay for computing resources as you use them. If you’d like to try it out, new users can claim a $300 Google Cloud credit to test out the platform and perform some small analyses. We also provide a cost estimator. 1.0.3 Where Can I Get Help? Please visit our community support forum at help.anvilproject.org with any questions (or suggestions!) you may have. 1.0.4 How to Use This Book This book is not intended to be read through sequentially, rather, it is a collection of guides that you can reference based on your needs. It is divided into two major sections: Account Setup Step-by-step instructions for new AnVIL users to set up their accounts and start using the AnVIL platform. We have included recommendations for configuring your accounts based on several common use cases: PIs and Lab Managers: managing a team of researchers working on AnVIL Data Analysts: joining a team working on AnVIL Consortia: using AnVIL as part of a research consortium Working on AnVIL Examples and walkthroughs of common tasks on the AnVIL platform: Workspaces: how to create and clone research spaces on AnVIL Tools: how to run common tools including Jupyter Notebooks, Galaxy, and RStudio Data: how to find and access AnVIL datasets, as well as upload and manage your own data Workflows: how to find and run existing automated data processing pipelines, and how to customize and share your own 1.0.5 Activate scroll_highlight Feature Note that some sections of this book cover steps in a lot of detail.

"],["overview-pis.html", "2.1 Account Setup Overview", " 2.1 Account Setup Overview 2.1.1 Goals for This Guide 2.1.2 Design Philosophy This guide provides an opinionated walkthrough on how to set up AnVIL for your lab, based on experiences from many labs actively using AnVIL. These step-by-step instructions take team leads that are completely new to the AnVIL through account setup to the point where team members can start working on AnVIL. Following the recommendations in this guide will help you more clearly see where charges are coming from and have greater control over which users can spend your money and access your data. In support of these goals we have made the following design decisions: COST CONTROL Prevent charges to your funding account until you explicitly give authorization by starting with Google’s free $300 credit program Control who can charge to your account by limiting who can “share” permission to compute - yourself and any designated “Lab Managers” COST TRANSPARENCY Allow fine-grain accounting of who spent what by creating individual “Billing Projects” for each user Monitor costs by setting up email alerts to warn you when you reach spending thresholds Enable detailed analysis of costs by exporting cost data using BigQuery DATA ACCESS CONTROLS Reduce unwanted access by limiting who can “share” your data and analyses - yourself and any designated “Lab Managers” Stricter data access management can be enforced through “Authorization Domains”; however this can make future sharing and publication difficult. This guide recommends avoiding Authorization Domains for most uses, especially as you are starting out. If you are working with highly sensitive data, see this documentation for more information. These design decisions are made to help you get up and running as quickly as possible without overwhelming new users. As your experience and comfort with AnVIL grows, you will likely change your design to better match your unique needs e.g. enabling Authorization Domains when working with protected data. 2.1.3 Before You Start You will need a credit card or bank account to activate your free trial and get started. Don’t worry! You won’t be billed until you explicitly turn on automatic billing, but payment information is needed for verification purposes. Before setting up billing yourself, you may want to check with your institutional procurement office and see if they have a preferred account set-up method with Google (such as a third party reseller or an existing account). To add lab members, you will need to know the Google account they will use to access Terra. You can complete most setup steps without this information and then add them once you know the correct accounts. 2.1.4 Starting Setup AnVIL uses Terra to run analyses. Terra operates on Google Cloud Platform, so you’ll pay for all storage and analysis costs through a Google account linked to Terra. The costs are the standard Google Cloud Platform fees for storing and moving data as well as executing an analysis. These costs are passed along through Terra without any markup. Create a Google account Set up Google Billing (and claim your free credits!). Add an administrator or viewer (optional) Link Terra to the Google Billing Account Create Terra Billing Projects Set budgets and alerts (optional, but highly recommended) Add users and Workspaces 2.1.5 Lab Management Roles While there are many ways to configure your lab, this guide defines the following roles and responsibilities: PI - The PI sets up the lab’s Google Cloud Account, creates its Google Billing Account(s), and Google Payment Method(s), links Terra with GCP, and invites Lab Managers to be Google Cloud “Billing Account Users.” Lab Manager (Optional) - A Lab Manager creates or clones Terra Workspaces and manages who can use those Workspaces. The Lab Manager is also responsible for creating one or more Terra Billing Projects configuring GCP budgets and alerts. Importantly, lab managers control who can spend lab money and should have an understanding of Google Cloud Billing and Terra Billing Projects. Depending on your lab, the PI may choose to be the only Lab Manager, or may appoint trusted lab members to assist. Data Analyst - A lab member who is granted write + can-compute access on one or more Terra Workspaces by a Lab Manager and who will run analyses in Terra. Data Analysts cannot share Terra Workspaces (this prevents them from enabling others to spend lab money).

If you would like to create a Google account that is associated with your non-Gmail, institutional email address, follow these instructions. "],["step-2-set-up-google-billing.html", "2.3 Step 2: Set Up Google Billing", " 2.3 Step 2: Set Up Google Billing Terra operates on Google Cloud Platform, and does not charge any markup. Rather than paying Terra or AnVIL, users set up billing directly with Google Cloud Platform. Make sure to use the same Google account ID you use to log into Terra for Google Cloud Billing. To set up billing, you must first create a Google “Billing Account”. You can create multiple Billing Accounts associated with your Google ID. We recommend creating separate Billing Accounts for different funding sources. 2.3.1 Create a Google Billing Account Log in to the Google Cloud Platform console using your Google ID. Make sure to use the same Google account ID you use to log into Terra. If you are a first time user, don’t forget to claim your free credits! If you haven’t been to the console before, once you accept the Terms of Service you will be greeted with an invitation to “Try for Free.” Follow the instructions to sign up for a Billing Account and get your credits. Choose “Individual Account”. This “billing account” is just for managing billing, so you don’t need to be able to add your lab members. You will need to give either a credit card or bank account for security. Don’t worry! You won’t be billed until you explicitly turn on automatic billing. You can view and edit your new Billing Account, by selecting “Billing” from the left-hand menu, or going direction to the billing console console.cloud.google.com/billing Clicking on the Billing Account name will allow you to manage the account, including accessing reports, setting alerts, and managing payments and billing. We will cover account management in greater detail below. At any point, you can create additional Billing Accounts using the Create Account button. We recommend creating a new Billing Account for each funding source. 2.3.2 Add Users or Viewers (optional) If you have a project manager or finance administrator who needs access to a Billing Account, you can add them with a few different levels of permissions. Generally the most useful are: Users have a great deal of power over spending - they can create new “Billing Projects” and control who can spend money on those projects. If you have a lab or accounts manager responsible for expenses, it may make sense to add them as a Billing Account User. If you wish to retain full control over who can spend money on GCP, you should not add any Users. Viewers can see the activity in the Billing Account but can’t make any changes. This can be useful for finance staff who need access to the reports, or for lab members to be able to see what their analyses are costing. Anyone you wish to add to the Billing Account will need their own Google ID. To add a member to a Billing Project: Log in to the Google Cloud Platform console using your Google ID. Navigate to Billing You may be automatically directed to view a specific Billing Account. If you see information about a single account rather than a list of your Billing Accounts, you can get back to the list by clicking “Manage Billing Accounts” from the drop-down menu. Check the box next to the Billing Account you wish to add a member to, click “ADD MEMBER”. Enter their Google ID in the text box. In the drop-down menu, mouse over Billing, then choose the appropriate role. Click “SAVE”.

"],["step-4-create-terra-billing-projects.html", "2.5 Step 4: Create Terra Billing Projects", " 2.5 Step 4: Create Terra Billing Projects This is how you enable Terra users to charge to the Google Billing Account. Note that Google will report charges at the level of Billing Projects. If you create only one Billing Project for your lab, you will not be able to see a breakdown of where charges are coming from. It is highly recommended that you create separate Billing Projects for each category of spending you would like to track. For example: A Billing Project for each lab member, if you would like to track individual spending A Billing Project for each analysis type, if you would like to track spending on e.g. RNA-seq vs. variant calling. A Billing Project for each cohort, if you would like to track spending per data set If you are uncertain, we recommend starting by setting up a Billing Project per lab member. This makes it easy to track lab member spending, and also makes it easier to cleanly shut down projects when a member leaves the lab. 2.5.1 Create a Billing Project Launch Terra and sign in with your Google account. Make sure to use the same Google account that you used to set up Google Billing. If this is your first time logging in to Terra, you will need to accept the Terms of Service. In the drop-down menu on the left, navigate to “Billing”. Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click the arrow next to your name to expand the menu, then click “Billing”. On the Billing page, click the “+ CREATE” button to create a new Billing Project. If prompted, select the Google account to use. Make sure to use the same Google account that you used to set up Google Billing. If prompted, give Terra permission to manage Google Cloud Platform billing accounts. Enter a unique name for your Terra Billing Project and select the appropriate Google Billing Account. The name of the Terra Billing Project must: Only contain lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens Start with a lowercase letter Not end with a hyphen Be between 6 and 30 characters Be unique across all Google Billing Projects The page doesn’t always update as soon as the billing project is created. If it’s been a couple of minutes and you don’t see a change, try refreshing the page. As mentioned above, we recommend creating separate Terra Billing Projects for each of your team members so you can track their spending. These Billing Projects can all be associated with the same Google Billing Account if they are all funded by the same source. Having trouble?

"],["step-5-set-budgets-and-alerts.html", "2.6 Step 5: Set Budgets and Alerts", " 2.6 Step 5: Set Budgets and Alerts Cloud computing can save a great deal of money, time and effort by providing compute on an as-needed basis. However, care must be taken that users do not accidentally request excessive resources, or leave resources running when not needed. Unfortunately, there are two issues that make direct cost control difficult: The Google Cloud billing interface does not provide a way to automatically cancel computations when a spending threshold is reached Compute costs are reported with a delay (~1 day) As a PI or lab manager, there are some steps you can take to help monitor and limit spending: Be careful with members and permissions in your Billing Projects and Workspaces on Terra (see Adding Users and Workspaces for recommended setup) Most importantly, monitor your spending so you can shut down unnecessary expensive activities before they have time to accumulate. Terra provides extensive documentation and examples regarding cost management while working in the cloud We highly recommended you set budgets and alerts to notify you if spending starts to exceed expectations. This will make it easier to notice and shut down any accidental overspending. A good starting point is to set a monthly budget, and then set alerts at 50 percent and 90 percent of expected spend. You can add additional alerts if you desire. You can set a single Budget for your entire lab, set up individual budgets for each Billing Project, or even set budgets for certain subsets of your Billing Projects. This will depend on the size of your lab and how closely you want to monitor spending. More granular budgets make it quicker to notice and track down overspending from a particular project but mean you will get more emails every month. When setting budgets with broader scope, you can always find out which particular Billing Project is spending the money by checking in the GCP Billing interface. NOTE: that there may be some restrictions on the budgets and alerts you can set while you’re using GCP’s free credits. At the time of writing (Feb 2021) you are not able to set budgets for individual projects while you are using the GCP free credits, but can still set an overall budget. Any restrictions should be lifted when you upgrade to a paid account. 2.6.1 Set Alerts Log in to the Google Cloud Platform console using your Google ID. Navigate to Billing You may be automatically directed to view a specific Billing Account. If you see information about a single account (other than the one you’re interested in), you can get back to the list of all your Billing Accounts by clicking “Manage Billing Accounts” from the drop-down menu. Click on the name of the Billing Account you want to set alerts for. In the left-hand menu, click “Budgets &amp; alerts”. Click “Create Budget”. Enter a name for your budget, and then choose what you want to monitor. Click “Next”. For Budget Type, select “Specified amount”. Enter the total budget amount for the month (you will set alerts at different thresholds in the next step). Click “Next” (not “Finish”). Enter the threshold amounts where you want to receive an alert. We recommend starting with 50% and 90%. You can set other alerts if you prefer. Check the box for “Email alerts to billing admins and users”. Click “Finish”. Now you (as the owner and admin), along with anyone you added with admin or user privileges (e.g lab managers) will receive alerts when your lab members reach the specified spending thresholds. These emails will be sent to the Gmail accounts associated with the Billing Account. You can edit your budgets at any time by going to Billing &gt; Budgets &amp; alerts, and clicking on the name of the budget you want to edit. 2.6.2 View spend You can always check your current spend through the Google Billing console, but remember There is a reporting delay (~1 day), so you cannot immediately see what an analysis cost Costs are reported at the level of Billing Projects, so if you have not created separate Billing Projects, you will not be able to determine where charges are coming from. The Google Billing console displays information by Billing Account. To view spending: Log in to the Google Cloud Platform console using your Google ID. Navigate to Billing You may be automatically directed to view a specific Billing Account. If you see information about a single account (other than the one you’re interested in), you can get back to the list of all your Billing Accounts by clicking “Manage Billing Accounts” from the drop-down menu. Click on the name of the Billing Account for the project you want to view. Look at the top of the Overview tab to see your month-to-date spending. Scroll further down the Overview tab to show your top projects. Click on the Reports tab to see more detailed information about each of your billing projects. This is probably the most useful tab for exploring costs of individual projects over time. Click on the Cost table tab to obtain a convenient table of spending per project. 2.6.3 Export Cost Data to BigQuery Coming soon – instructions on how to export your cost data so you can better analyze and control your expenses. "],["step-6-add-users-and-workspaces.html", "2.7 Step 6: Add Users and Workspaces", " 2.7 Step 6: Add Users and Workspaces Finally, back on Terra, you can add lab members and give them permission to run analyses funded through your Billing Projects. There are two primary ways to permit users to charge to your Billing Projects: Add them directly to the Billing Project. This gives them flexibility to create and manage their own Workspaces, but reduces your control over spending. Anyone they add to their Workspaces with sufficient permissions (i.e. permission to compute) can charge to your Billing Project. Create a Workspace yourself, and add them to the Workspace (or have a designated Lab Manager responsible for managing Workspaces). This gives you much more control over who can charge to your Billing Project. Billing permissions on Terra can be confusing. For this reason, We recommend starting by having a single person responsible for managing all Workspaces (either yourself or a trusted “lab manager”). This person should create all Workspaces and add lab members as Writers (not Owners) to the Workspaces. This provides the greatest control over spending. Once you are familiar with the permissions system and are certain your lab members understand the implication of different permission settings, you may decide to give them greater control over Workspace access. 2.7.1 Create a New Workspace Launch Terra In the drop-down menu on the left, navigate to “Workspaces”. Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click “Workspaces”. Click on the plus icon near the top of left of the page. Name your Workspace and select the appropriate Billing Project. All activity in the Workspace will be charged to this Billing Project (regardless of who conducted it). If you are working with protected data, you can set the Authorization Domain to limit who can be added to your Workspace. Note that the Authorization Domain cannot be changed after the Workspace is created (i.e. there is no way to make this Workspace shareable with a larger audience in the future). Workspaces by default are only visible to people you specifically share them with. Authorization domains add an extra layer of enforcement over privacy, but by nature make sharing more complicated. We recommend using Authorization Domains in cases where it is extremely important and/or legally required that the data be kept private (e.g. protected patient data, industry data). For data you would merely prefer not be shared with the world, we recommend relying on standard Workspace sharing permissions rather than Authorization Domains, as Authorization Domains can make future collaborations, publications, or other sharing complicated. Click “CREATE WORKSPACE”. The new Workspace should now show up under your Workspaces. To start, we recommend creating one Workspace for each lab member (associated with that lab member’s Billing Project, with separate Billing Projects for your lab members). This will enable you and your lab members to familiarize yourself with Workspaces and decide how best to organize your work. You can then create additional Workspaces as needed (there are no limits on the number of Workspaces). 2.7.2 Add Members to Workspaces Lab members must have logged in to Terra at least once before they can be added to your Billing Projects and Workspaces (they do not need to log in to Google Cloud Console). You can send lab members to the Data Analysts guide for instructions on how they can sign up and start working on AnVIL. Launch Terra In the drop-down menu on the left, navigate to “Workspaces”. Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click “Workspaces”. Click on the name of the Workspace to open the Workspace. Opening a Workspace does not cost anything. Certain activities in the Workspace (such as running an analysis) will charge to the Workspace’s Billing Project. Workspace management (e.g. adding and removing members, editing the description) does not cost money. Click the circle with 3 dots on the right hand side to open the Workspace management menu. Click “Share” Enter the email address of the user you want to share the Workspace with. This must be the address associated with the account they are using to access Terra. Choose their permission level. We recommend adding lab members as Writers to start. This gives them permission to freely use the Workspace, (adding and removing data, conducting analyses, etc.) but prevents them from adding additional members who could charge to your Billing Project. “Can compute” should be checked “Can share” should NOT be checked Click “Save”. The user should now be able to see the Workspace when logged in to Terra. 2.7.3 User Access Levels and Permissions Managing permissions for your Workspace has important implications: Billing: Terra charges are associated with Workspaces rather than users. Any billable activity that takes place in a given Workspace will be charged to the associated Billing Project, regardless of who conducted the activity. If there are multiple users with permission to compute, you won’t be able to tell who conducted the activity. Data access: Especially when working with protected data, it’s important to ensure that users have proper authorization to view the data before giving them access to a Workspace containing the data. Terra provides Authorization Domains to assist with this. In general we recommend: Writers: Lab members who need permission to compute (and charge to your Billing Project). Readers: All other users (i.e. users who need to see the Workspace but should not charge to your Billing Project). Readers can always “clone” the Workspace (creating a copy of it associated with their own Billing Project) if they want to run computations themselves. If working with protected data, take advantage of Authorization Domains to increase security. More details about the permissions associated with each Access Level can be found in the Terra documentation. "],["pis-wrap-up.html", "2.8 Wrap-Up", " 2.8 Wrap-Up Congratulations!

This guide will be most helpful to you if you target the section most closely related to your role. The sections are summarized by role below: Data Manager The data manager is responsible for controlling access of consortium members. To protect data security, data managers ensure that consortium members only have access to appropriate datasets. If there are multiple datasets, the data manager will manage consortium member access as appropriate to a subset of those datasets. These limited access permissions are organized via distinct Terra Authorization Domains. Principal Investigator / Lab Manager Principal Investigators are responsible for managing billing expenses accrued by members of the consortium. Within the consortium, PIs can add members to Workspaces managed under specific Google Billing Accounts and Billing Projects, providing centralized control over computing and data storage expenses. Principal Investigators will need to work with data managers to ensure their team members have correct data access via Terra Authorization Domains, where necessary. Data Analyst / Researcher A consortium data analyst might describe someone who is performing analyses or writing code, but isn’t responsible for managing dataset access or billing expenses. The Analyst should be able to identify the PI or data manager point of contact in the consortium. Analysts will not be able to run analyses or access data without explicit permission from consortium management. This role also describes research leaders who will participate in activities but will not be managing personnel or expenses as part of the consortium. Data Submitter Data submitters are responsible for working with the AnVIL Data Ingestion Team as well as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) to make data available on AnVIL. Data submitters will work with the data manager to ensure the data is protected via the appropriate Terra Authorization Domains. 4.1.3 Consortia Responsibilities It is important for consortium members of all roles to have a common understanding of the consortium’s security and data access policies. Consortia leadership are responsible for the following: Drafting Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) and Data Use Agreements (DUAs) Arranging IRB oversight Drafting policy and protocol for data security and management incidents Ensuring all consortium members are aware of all data use limitations and the terms of the consortium agreements Defining what it means to be a consortium member Developing clear timelines and milestones for sharing data with the community rapidly, completely, and in NIH-designated data repositories Creating a timeline for closing out the consortium and thus the consortium-managed, streamlined access for consortium members Communicating the timeline with relevant NHGRI program staff and provide AnVIL with 6 months’ notice of when the consortium’s data access is expected to end "],["consortium-data-managers.html", "4.2 Consortium Data Managers", " 4.2 Consortium Data Managers 4.2.1 Managing Security and Privacy Policies As a data manager, you are responsible for managing access to sensitive data.

The Workspace Bucket is a special Google Cloud Storage bucket that is governed by the built-in AnVIL security policies. This durable and scalable storage location is suitable for both raw data as well as analysis outputs that need to be preserved and/or shared. In contrast, Persistent Disks provide a working directory for Cloud Environments that run Jupyter, RStudio, and Galaxy. Input data can be localized to Persistent Disks for analysis while output data can be transferred to the Workspace Bucket for more reliable long term storage. Data Tables provide a way to organize data and metadata, including URI links to storage buckets. These tables are a convenient way to organize input for analyses as well as tracking workflow outputs.

Using the following resources can help you discover data to use in your analyses. 7.2.1 AnVIL Data Library The Datasets Library is a good place to get started and familiarize yourself with existing data. Here, you can find curated datasets from thousands of participants. Some of these are open access (such as the 1000 Genomes dataset) while others will require you to request access. Taking a look at Featured Workspaces can get you started quickly. Remember that when you clone a Workspace, AnVIL automatically cross-links to the original data contained within the Data Tables. 7.2.2 AnVIL Dataset Catalog The AnVIL Dataset Catalog displays key NHGRI datasets accessible in AnVIL, such as the CCDG (Centers for Common Disease Genomics), CMG (Centers for Mendelian Genomics), eMERGE (Electronic Medical Records and Genomics), as well as other relevant datasets. You will need to coordinate access to controlled data. 7.2.3 Gen3 Data Explorer The Gen3 Data Explorer and Data Commons provides their API for data queries and downloads, supporting cross-project analyses. Gen3 provides access to open and protected datasets that can be exported to an AnVIL Workspace. For example, users can find the 1000 Genomes dataset on Gen3 and filter by ancestry, age, and other features prior to performing analyses on AnVIL. "],["workflows.html", "Chapter 8 Workflows", " Chapter 8 Workflows Workflows allow you to run whole genomic pipelines in Terra. Workflows are written in WDL (Workflow Description Language), which is a human-readable and writable language originally developed for genomic analysis pipelines.

This integration allows you to easily configure a workflow from your Workspace. Established workflows help make analyses more reproducible. They also make it easier to configure, launch, and monitor analyses across many samples. You can access workflows from a Workspace by clicking on the Workflows Tab. To run a workflow you can either use a pre-configured workflow, or create your own workflow. 8.0.1 Pre-configured Workflow You will need to clone a Workspace that contains the workflow you’d like to run.

"],["budget-templates.html", "D Budget Templates", " D Budget Templates If you want to apply for a grant and you plan to use the AnVIL platform for data storage, data movement, and data analysis, you can include the anticipated costs in your proposal. We have created a template for the budget justification paragraph of your grant proposal. The documents described in the following provide you with insightful knowledge. D.0.1 Types of Costs There are three types of costs that are typically occur when performing operations on the Google Cloud Platform. 1. Cost for Computing is driven by your particular CPU and memory requirements. Importantly, you can save money if your work can tolerate being interrupted (also known as a preemptible compute resource). In this case, you pay less per hour with the understanding that your work may be interrupted by a customer willing to pay more. Details and current pricing can be found here. 2. Cost for Storage is driven by the amount of data and the length of time you wish to store the data. Here, you can save money if you have data that you do not plan to access frequently. This would be the case for raw data that has already been processed, backups, and archives. Details and current pricing can be found here. 3. Cost for Network Usage (egress) applies to data being transferred out of a Cloud resource. In this context, a Cloud resource refers to a set of computers in a particular region. This would apply, for example, if you transferred data from Google’s East Coast computers to Amazon’s West Coast computers. In general, while it’s free to upload data to the Cloud, you will incur costs when downloading data to your local computer or between Cloud regions. Details and current pricing can be found here. D.0.2 Usage of Budget Templates In a first step, you can use the template Google Sheet AnVIL_Cost_Estimator to calculate costs for computing, storage, and network usage (egress) for your proposal. In a second step, you can use the template Google Doc AnVIL_Budget_Justification to create a budget justification paragraph for your proposal by including the information highlighted in pink (mostly copying entries from your Google Sheet AnVIL_Cost_Estimator). Please download and adapt both documents to your project. Please check that the prices are up to date by using the links listed below or in the AnVIL_Cost_Estimator. For further guidance, you can have a look at a completed document AnVIL_Budget_Justification_Example. "],["irb-templates.html", "E IRB Templates", " E IRB Templates If you plan to use the AnVIL platform for data storage, data movement, and data analysis, you will likely need to provide information about AnVIL in your IRB application. While all IRBs will have different questions and requirements, there are general areas of concern that are common across IRB applications. The following sections provide general information about AnVIL as well as examples of language addressing some of these concerns. E.0.1 General Information When writing an IRB research plan you will be required to fill out a few fields about data collection and data storage. The following sections provide the information that you will need for these IRB sections. There is also language regarding consent, with some suggested text that you may include in the IRB research plan and your consent form. If you are using AnVIL, you should know that the storage is on Google Cloud Platform, so it is encrypted, it is not stored on a secure server, and it is backed up through multi-site replication. Important things to know about AnVIL security are that there are four key design concepts: Authenticate: All components require authentication at every step, not just the perimeter Authorize: All data requires explicit authorization to access Audit: All data access is logged (to a different system), with alerts for anomalous events Encrypt: All data-in-transit and all data-at-rest is encrypted There is language below about data storage, which you will need for your research plan. There is also a section about privacy and confidentiality, which you will also need. E.0.2 Description of AnVIL The NHGRI Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-Space, or AnVIL provides a collaborative environment for creating and sharing data and analysis workflows for both users with limited computational expertise and sophisticated data scientist users. The platform is built on a set of established components that have been used in a number of flagship scientific projects: The Terra platform: provides a compute environment with secure data and analysis sharing capabilities Dockstore: provides standards based sharing of containerized tools and workflows The Gen3 data commons framework: provides data and metadata ingest, querying, and organization Bioconductor and Galaxy: provide environments for users at different skill levels to construct and execute analyses E.0.3 Data Storage We will keep a copy of the participant’s genomics data in various data formats (formats - CRAMs, BAMs, vcfs, BCLs, fastqs). This will be stored in Broad’s Google Cloud services, which is the underlying storage platform for AnVIL. The Google Cloud Platform has summarized its services with respect to genomics data processing in a white paper here: https://cloud.google.com/files/genomics-data-wp.pdf E.0.4 Privacy and Confidentiality There is a small risk of loss of privacy and confidentiality for the participant and their personal health information. While it is unlikely, there is a possibility that genetic information could be seen by unauthorized individuals. Researchers who will have access to genetic information about participants will take measures to maintain the privacy of the participant and confidentiality of their information. E.0.5 Security Terra (powered by Broad Genomics’ Workbench) is operated by the Broad Institute at the FISMA (Federal Information Systems Management Act) “moderate” level and received Authority to Operate from NCI and NIH in May of 2016. FISMA is a practice of documentation, audit, and organizational risk acceptance. It is centered on the controls outlined in NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Special Publications 800-30 and 800-53. Covered topics include: Network penetration testing and assessment by a Federally authorized outside firm Maintaining system logs separate from the primary system for forensic analysis Regular review of logs and changes by an in-house auditor Security training and background screening for staff with elevated access to the system Documented procedures to respond to security incidents The Terra portal and its underlying platform, Broad Genomics’ Workbench, are hosted on Google’s Cloud Services. See below for details. Since Terra requires that users utilize Google logins, the application operates on top of Google’s world-class security that protects from nation-state level attacks. Terra supports the use of Google’s 2 Factor authentication as well. As a FISMA Moderate system, all logs are audited continually and various levels of security layering are required. These include Web Application Firewalls, weekly scanning, code scanning (dynamic and static), dependency scanning and manual penetration testing. Data analysis is constrained to computing nodes that are sandboxed using Docker within Google’s Pipelines API. Google undergoes several independent third party audits on a regular basis to provide verification of security, privacy and compliance controls including annual audits for SSAE 16/ISAE 3402 Type II. Google’s infrastructure provides reliable information security that can meet or exceed the requirements of HIPAA and protected health information. Broad Information Security &amp; Compliance Team provides risk review and consulting security services for legacy, current, and future computing infrastructure, applications, and information services across the enterprise. Risk management and mitigation services are also provided to assist business units with meeting regulatory requirements. The team also takes a lead role in incident response processes, including network, system, and data forensic efforts and is responsible for developing and ensuring proper review of all security policies, standards, and procedures. The Senior Director of Information Security &amp; Compliance (DISC) facilitates the development and maintenance of the information security program, leads the development of information security policies, standards and procedures, and collaborates with business and system owners in understanding their security responsibilities. The DISC also promotes consistency in the development and implementation of strategic initiatives and policies based on industry and regulatory standards (FISMA, etc). The Broad Institute has a strong commitment to information security, appropriate use of data, compliance with applicable regulations, and respect for data privacy. E.0.6 Example Language for Informed Consent Below we provide some possible language that could be used for consent forms. E.0.6.1 Types of Research We may use your sample to do other biological and genetic research. Genetic research may include looking at some or all of your genes and DNA to see if there are links to different types of health conditions. We may use your sample and your DNA sequence information to help create new analytical and machine learning methods to look at genomic and clinical data. We may share your samples, your DNA sequence information, your health information, and results from our research results with other data banks, such as those sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, so that researchers from around the world can use them to study many conditions. A code will be assigned to your samples and health information. Your name, medical record number, or other information that easily identifies you will not be stored with your samples or health information. The key to the code that connects your name to your samples and information will be stored securely in a controlled access database. This method is discussed more below. E.0.6.2 Data Repository Submission Your individual genomic data and health information may be put in a controlled-access data commons. This means that only researchers who apply for and get permission to use the information for a specific research project will be able to access the information. If this happens, your genomic data and health information will not be labeled with your name or other information that could be used to identify you. Your data and information will be entered in the database with the random study identifier created by the research team. Researchers approved to access information in the database will agree not to attempt to identify you. E.0.6.3 Potential Risks Every research study involves the risk of loss of privacy. The personal information that will be associated with your WGS cannot typically be used to identify you. However, it is possible that in the future there may be a way to link stored genomic information back to you. We believe that the possibility of this is low. Your information will be stored on a cloud-computing storage system administered by The Broad Institute.
