<details><summary>Amount of data on AnVIL</summary>

As discussed in the [flagship AnVIL paper](https://www.cell.com/cell-genomics/fulltext/), the AnVIL hosts data from >280,000 human genomes from >240 different cohorts spanning multiple consortia and major NHGRI projects. The AnVIL offers a browsable catalog of summary information about all of the datasets so that even if a user isn't authorized to access the data itself, they can better determine if the data will be helpful for their research if they need to apply for authorization for access. AnVIL is working to facilitate data harmonization across studies, ensuring consistency and interoperability, which is critical for large-scale analyses. These efforts will increase the value of the AnVIL data and maximize its utility to the researcher community.

<details><summary>AnVIL is a FedRAMP Moderate compliant platform</summary>

As a [FedRAMP Moderate compliant platform](https://www.fedramp.gov/rev5/baselines/), AnVIL maintains FedRAMP authorization of compliance to ensure as a cloud service provider, minimum security requirements are met for data processing, storage, and transmission of Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) where loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability would result in serious adverse effect or non-life threatening harm. All steps necessary to maintain compliance, such as robust logging of access to data, periodic audits by third-party analysts, and monitoring for abnormal use patterns are managed and guaranteed by AnVIL.

</details>

:::

### Data & analysis in same place

<img src="01-intro_files/figure-html//1zq27o5gSWeiaEPqbCTTL3c_zvozN5lg_QNJYRVyM-SI_g36e681c6048_0_179.png" alt="The AnVIL portal is an entry point for all parts of AnVIL, allowing visitors to launch Terra to work on AnVIL, as well as access important announcements or documentation." width="100%" />


AnVIL is a unified computing environment for data storage, management, and analysis. The [AnVIL portal](https://anvilproject.org) serves as an entry point to access all parts of the AnVIL system as well as training materials and announcements. 

### Scalability


AnVIL is conducive to analysis at massive scale and for data exploration and training. Researchers get access to dedicated compute resources, avoiding queue time and lack of access at some institutions. Researchers can also launch light environments or run test analyses without incurring much cost or spending a lot of time to configure.

### Rent needed resources


AnVIL allows you to rent the computational resources that you need for occasional high demand needs rather than obtaining and maintaining the same resources yourself or paying a subscription for an allocation/constant access (with little consistent use over time). AnVIL can provide different hardware and software setups, rather than preparing the environment yourself (or relying on an institutional core to do it and waiting in the queue).

::: {.click_to_expand_block}

<details><summary>Additional considerations</summary>

Other considerations that make renting computational resources from AnVIL appealing compared to obtaining and maintaining your own resources or upgrading an institutional allocation (HPC) include:

* AnVIL is compliant with protected data. Some institutional HPCs may not be.
* Once your group is initially set up on AnVIL, adding users (with specified permissions) is easier than trying to add a user to an allocation through an email chain.
* Because AnVIL maintains docker images, the exact version of a tool is documented and available.
* AnVIL scales well for large numbers of samples and won't require long waits in queues to access limited, specialized resources; AnVIL also works well for small analyses where you may not want to connect to the HPC and set up a complicated environment there.

### Role-based permissions

<img src="01-intro_files/figure-html//1zq27o5gSWeiaEPqbCTTL3c_zvozN5lg_QNJYRVyM-SI_g36e681c6048_0_152.png" alt="A workspace is the fundamental unit of activity in AnVIL with role-based access. The workspace will show the user’s access level (e.g., whether they are an owner or reader or writer who has the ability to run compute or share). This helps to enable collaboration. The Access level of the user is highlighted in this example workspace." width="100%" />


[Group management](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360022704371-Navigating-in-Terra) can be utilized to control who can access specific data, analysis workspaces, and your billing resources. [Workspaces provide a collaborative environment](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360024743371-Working-with-workspaces) with role-based permissions. These [permission include reading, writing, or owning with additional permissions for running compute and sharing](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360025851892-Sharing-data-and-tools-with-workspace-access-controls). Especially within the contexts of working with sensitive data or large amounts of data, AnVIL's role-based group management permission structure is instrumental.

### Shareable workspaces

<img src="01-intro_files/figure-html//1zq27o5gSWeiaEPqbCTTL3c_zvozN5lg_QNJYRVyM-SI_g36e681c6048_0_166.png" alt="A workspace can serve as a shareable record of analyses. The ability to access the permalink to the example workspace is highlighted in this image." width="100%" />


[Workspaces](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360024743371-Working-with-workspaces) can contain data, metadata, and analysis tools, as well as documentation and history of workflow runs, additionally displaying important information such as when the workspace was created and last modified. AnVIL workspaces on the web can serve as shareable, reproducible records of analyses. Research conducted on the AnVIL platform has contributed to over 115 scientific publications citing the AnVIL paper, demonstrating its role in advancing genomic and biomedical research.

### Repository compliant with DMS Policy


The AnVIL serves as a [cloud data repository compliant with the Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy](https://anvilproject.org/overview/dms-requirements). Data access controls can be specified to limit data access and use.

By submitting their data to AnVIL, not only can researchers meet the requirements of DMS Policy, they can also [contribute to the expanding network of NIH funded data housed in the AnVIL](https://terra.bio/anvil-platform-helps-meet-the-new-nih-data-management-and-sharing-policy-requirements/), furthering scientific discovery.

::: {.click_to_expand_block}

<details><summary>What is DMS Policy?</summary>

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Data Management and Sharing (DMS) policy requires that all NIH-supported research which generates [scientific data](https://hutchdatascience.org/NIH_Data_Sharing/how-will-this-policy-affect-me.html#scientific-data) (barring ethical, legal, or technical factors [limiting data sharing](https://hutchdatascience.org/NIH_Data_Sharing/how-will-this-policy-affect-me.html#when-to-not-share)) must create a plan and budget for data management and sharing.

While some funding announcements for some research may specify which repository should be used to comply with DMS policy, mostly the NIH does not specify [where data should be stored.](https://hutchdatascience.org/NIH_Data_Sharing/data-management-and-storage.html#data-repositories). The NIH does provide an [interactive table listing NIH supported data repositories](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data/repositories-for-sharing-scientific-data) than can be used and [suggests that researchers use a repository most appropriate for the data generated from their research](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data/selecting-a-data-repository).

## Overall benefits of AnVIL

<img src="01-intro_files/figure-html//1zq27o5gSWeiaEPqbCTTL3c_zvozN5lg_QNJYRVyM-SI_g37132c23502_0_80.png" alt="The general benefits of using the AnVIL include the ability to control cloud-computing costs, being able to safely work with protected data, maintenance is handled by others not the users, training and support is available for users, and the AnVIL is a collaborative community with a development mindset." width="100%" />

### Ability to control costs


Cloud computing is not free and estimating costs may seem daunting to those considering use of the AnVIL. However, Terra provides thorough, transparent [documentation explaining data storage and cloud computing costs](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360029748111-Overview-Controlling-Google-Cloud-costs-on-Terra) and has been working to improve transparency and management of costs for AnVIL users through [cost reporting, cost controls and estimates, and cost optimizations](https://terra.bio/tools-to-manage-terra-costs/). Additionally, in order to debug or benchmark your work, analyses or workflows can be tested with smaller scale test datasets or light environments without incurring much cost or spending a lot of time to configure environments.   

### Work with protected data safely


Due to AnVIL maintaining compliance with [FedRAMP](https://www.fedramp.gov/) policies, clinical data containing PHI and PII can be safely and securely stored and analyzed on AnVIL. This includes the ability to [export data from clinical data collection and management tools like REDCap and import it into AnVIL Terra Tables](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/28965977114651-AnVIL-User-Guide-for-REDCap).

### Maintenance is handled


Since AnVIL handles the support and maintenance of the platform (including the hardware and software), you can focus on performing your work on AnVIL rather than setting up and maintaining the platform, freeing up effort for your science. This is immensely valuable for researchers who do not have deep institutional IT and system administrator support for research infrastructure.

### Training and support is available


To equip researchers and students to work on the AnVIL, the AnVIL team

* provides and maintains [training materials](https://hutchdatascience.org/AnVIL_Collection/) and documentation in multiple formats (ex: [Getting Started on AnVIL](https://jhudatascience.org/AnVIL_Book_Getting_Started/)),
