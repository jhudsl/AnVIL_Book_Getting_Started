### Does AnVIL Cost Money?

Through AnVIL, you pay for computing resources as you use them.  If you'd like to try it out, new users can claim a $300 Google Cloud credit to test out the platform and perform some small analyses.

We also provide a [cost estimator](budget-templates.html#types-of-costs).

### Activate `scroll_highlight` Feature {#scroll-highlight}

Note that some sections of this book cover steps in a lot of detail. When navigating the table of contents, you can click subsection (e.g., 2.1, 4.3) headers a second time to expand the table of contents and enable the `scroll_highlight` feature. This can help you follow the separate steps within more clearly.
