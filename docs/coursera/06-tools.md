# Tools

Four of the analysis platforms available on AnVIL include Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, Galaxy, and WDL Workflows.  Each tool offers a unique set of strengths such as accessible analysis reports incorporating multiple languages in the case of [Jupyter](https://anvilproject.org/learn/interactive-analysis/getting-started-with-jupyter-notebooks), rich genomics support through [Bioconductor](https://anvilproject.org/learn/interactive-analysis/getting-started-with-bioconductor) in the case of RStudio, a graphical interface for thousands of tools in the case of [Galaxy](https://anvilproject.org/learn/interactive-analysis/getting-started-with-galaxy), and extreme compute scalability in the case of WDL Workflows.  This chapter focuses on launching and highlighting a few features for the three interactive tools while a later chapter discusses [WDL Workflows](workflows.html).
