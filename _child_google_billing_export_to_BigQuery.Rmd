Exporting billing data to BigQuery requires a few steps to set up:

1. Create GCP Project
1. Create BigQuery Dataset
1. Enable data export

**Create GCP Project**

First you will need to create a GCP Project that will run the export process.  

::: {.fyi}
Reminder:

- A Google **Billing Account** manages your *funding source* (e.g. credit card, cloud credits).  You probably only need one Billing Account unless you have multiple funding sources.
- A Google **Project** manages your GCP activities and cloud resources.  Multiple GCP Projects can be funded by a single Billing Account.
:::

Usually your GCP Projects are created and managed by Terra (corresponding to Terra Workspaces) and you don't need to manage them through the Google Cloud interface. In this case, you will need to create the GCP Project yourself. **This must be under the same Google Billing Account as the Projects you want to track spending for.**


To create a new GCP Project:

1. Log in to the [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/) console using the Google ID associated with your Google Cloud projects.

1. Open the dropdown menu on the top left, mouseover IAM & Admin, and click “Create a Project.”

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt='Screenshot of the Google Cloud Console drop-down menu, with the "IAM & Admin" submenu open. "IAM & Admin" and "Create a Project" are highlighted.'}

    ```
    
1. Enter a name for your new project.   Project names can contain only letters, numbers, single quotes, hyphens, spaces, or exclamation points, and must be between 4 and 30 characters.

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt='Screenshot of the GCP Project creation dialog. The text box labeled "Project name" is highlighted.'} '}

    ```

1. You may see an option to choose a location.  Unless you are part of a larger GCP organization, you can choose “No organization” for the location.

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt='Screenshot of the GCP Project creation dialog. The text box labeled "Location" is highlighted.'} '}

    ```

1. Click "Create".

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt='Screenshot of the GCP Project creation dialog. The "Create" button is highlighted.'} '}

    ```


**Create BigQuery Dataset**

Once your GCP Project exists, it can be used to create a BigQuery Dataset to hold your billing data.

To create a BigQuery Dataset:

1. Open the dropdown menu on the top left, and click “BigQuery.”  You may need to scroll down quite a ways before you see it.

    - If you’d like, you can pin BigQuery so it’s easier to find next time.

1. Make sure the correct GCP project is selected.  You can see the current project at the top of the screen.  If this is not correct, click on the project name to change it.

1. Find your project in the Explorer pane.  Click on the triple dots to see options, then click “Create dataset”.

1. Enter a Dataset ID.  As a reminder, this dataset will hold data for all projects funded by your Billing Account.

1. Next, it asks for a location.  You must select `US (multiple-regions)` in order to export detailed usage cost data.

1. Make sure that “Enable table expiration” is NOT checked.  Otherwise your billing data will be deleted when it expires.

1. Click “CREATE DATASET”.


```
# copied from GCP docs:

In the New Project window that appears, enter a project name and select a billing account as applicable.

```

**Enable data export**
	Go to the billing tab in the gcloud console and enable export to this dataset
Make sure the user of this software has the BigQuery scope on the billing project


Note that:

- You only need one BigQuery project per Google Billing Account. One BigQuery Project can handle cost data for multiple Billing Projects (i.e. lab members, cohorts, etc.), as long as they are all under the same Google Billing Account.
- If you are using multiple Google Billing Accounts (i.e. have multiple funding sources) you will need to set up a BigQuery project for each of them.
