## About this book

This book is part of a series of books for the NHGRI’s Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL).  Here, we present opinionated step-by-step guides for setting up accounts focused on three personas: PIs, Analysts, and Consortia. Additional guides are provided to help you with Workspaces, launch interactive tools, and start working with data.
